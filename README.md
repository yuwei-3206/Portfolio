# Yu-Wei Wu Portfolio

I created my portfolio using React.js to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. The purpose is to demonstrate my expertise in front-end development and my ability to build responsive, user-friendly applications.

## Front-End Technologies
### Custom Components
I created reusable custom components to modularize the code, making the portfolio easier to manage and maintain.

### Popup Modal Screens
Popup modal screens are used for displaying additional project information. They improve user interaction by providing a seamless way to access content without disrupting the flow of the application.

### Responsive Design
Responsive design ensures that the portfolio looks and functions well on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. I implemented media queries and flexible layouts to adapt the content to different screen sizes and orientations.

### State Management with React Hooks
React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, are employed for state management within the project. These hooks help manage component states and lifecycle events, enabling dynamic and interactive behavior, such as updating the UI in response to user actions.

### CSS for Styling
I used CSS for styling the portfolio, including custom fonts, color schemes, and layout adjustments. The styling ensures a visually appealing and consistent design throughout the project.
